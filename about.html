          <div class="aboutme_intro">I want to start my introduction with this story.
 

            In our lives, everybody has a special person who gives strong motivation. For me, the person is Michael Jackson. Ever since a kid, I was fascinated by his music and performance. He always tried to express his message in his music. He communicated with people around the world through music and gave a positive effect on their lives including me. Due to Michael Jackson’s inspiration, I also wanted to become an inspirational person who can affect people’s life. I want to express my message in my works and communicate globally.
            
            I’m interested in the creative industry and entertainment industry. So I studied culture contents and advertising in Hanyang University at South Korea. And I have implemented various personal &group projects. In this homepage, you can check on my works, projects, lecturings.
            
            Last year, I studied in China as an exchange student. I made a music video and film with students from other countries. The experience made me decided to start my real career in a different country.
            
             
            
            Right now, I’m in Toronto, Canada. I’m seeking a position where I can applicate my skills and experiences. Every company and project that vibe on my vision is welcome. If you are willing to work with me, feel free to contact.
